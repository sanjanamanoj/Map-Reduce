Train: contains the source code for training model on the labeled data
Test: contains the source code for testing the trained model on the unlabeled data
syslog: contains the syslog files for training and prediction for a successful AWS run.
Makefile: logic for running the entire map reduce program including training and prediction.


INSTRUCTIONS TO RUN:
1. Create a folder 'input' and place the labeled and unlabeled data inside this folder
2. Type 'make' in the command line for the parent directory
3. Type 'make run' in the command line for the parent directory

NOTE: 
1. For running the prediction map reduce job, the models should be present under the 'output' folder inside a folder called 'models'
2. In case of running 'make run' from the parent directory, point#1 is taken care by the entire program.
